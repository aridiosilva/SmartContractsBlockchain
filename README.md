##  What are Blockchain Smart Contracts ?

A smart contract is a computer program or a transaction protocol which is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement.

## What are the Objectives of Smart Contracts ?

The objectives of smart contracts are the reduction of need in trusted intermediators, arbitrations and enforcement costs, fraud losses, as well as the reduction of malicious and accidental exceptions.

## When they First Appear ?

Smart contracts were first proposed in the early 1990s by Nick Szabo, who coined the term, using it to refer to "a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises". In 1998, the term was used to describe objects in rights management service layer of the system The Stanford Infobus, which was a part of Stanford Digital Library Project.

## Legal Status of Smart Contracts

A smart contract does not necessarily constitute a valid binding agreement at law. Some legal academics claim that smart contracts are not legal agreements, but rather means of performing obligations deriving from other agreements such as technological means for the automation of payment obligations or obligations consisting in the transfer of tokens or cryptocurrencies. Additionally, other scholars have argued that the imperative or declarative nature of programming languages can impact the legal validity of smart contracts.

With the 2015's implementation of Ethereum, based on blockchains, "smart contract" is mostly used more specifically in the sense of general purpose computation that takes place on a blockchain or distributed ledger. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology describes a "smart contract" as a "collection of code and data (sometimes referred to as functions and state) that is deployed using cryptographically signed transactions on the blockchain network". In this interpretation, used for example by the Ethereum Foundation or IBM, a smart contract is not necessarily related to the classical concept of a contract, but can be any kind of computer program. A smart contract also can be regarded as a secured stored procedure as its execution and codified effects like the transfer of some value between parties are strictly enforced and can not be manipulated, after a transaction with specific contract details is stored into a blockchain or distributed ledger. That's because the actual execution of contracts is controlled and audited by the platform, not by any arbitrary server-side programs connecting to the platform.

In 2017, by implementing the Decree on Development of Digital Economy, Belarus has become the first-ever country to legalize smart contracts. Belarusian lawyer Denis Aleinikov is considered to be the author of a smart contract legal concept introduced by the decree.

In 2018, a US Senate report said: "While smart contracts might sound new, the concept is rooted in basic contract law. Usually, the judicial system adjudicates contractual disputes and enforces terms, but it is also common to have another arbitration method, especially for international transactions. With smart contracts, a program enforces the contract built into the code." A number of states in the US have passed legislation on the use of smart contracts, such as Arizona, Nevada, Tennessee, and Wyoming.

## Implementations of Smart Contracts

Similar to a transfer of value on a blockchain, deployment of a smart contract on a blockchain occurs by sending a transaction from a wallet for the blockchain. The transaction includes the compiled code for the smart contract as well as a special receiver address. That transaction must then be included in a block that is added to the blockchain, at which point the smart contract's code will execute to establish the initial state of the smart contract. 

Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithms secure the smart contract in a decentralized way from attempts to tamper with it. Once a smart contract is deployed, it cannot be updated.Smart contracts on a blockchain can store arbitrary state and execute arbitrary computations. 

End clients interact with a smart contract through transactions. Such transactions with a smart contract can invoke other smart contracts. These transactions might result in changing the state and sending coins from one smart contract to another or from one account to another. 

## Blockchain Platforms Supporting Smart Contracts

> - **Bitcoin** - *Provides a Turing-incomplete script language that allows the creation of custom smart contracts on top of Bitcoin like multisignature accounts, payment channels, escrows, time locks, atomic cross-chain trading, oracles, or multi-party lottery with no operator.*
> - **Ethereum** - *Implements a Turing-complete language on its blockchain, a prominent smart contract framework.*
> - **Ripple (Codius)** - *Smart contract development halted in 2015.*
> - **EOS.Io** - *A blockchain platform for smart contracts.*
> - **Tezos** - *A blockchain platform modifying its own set of rules with minimal disruption to the network through an on-chain governance model.*

## Smart Contract Eexecution

In 1998, Szabo proposed that smart contract infrastructure can be implemented by replicated asset registries and contract execution using cryptographic hash chains and Byzantine fault-tolerant replication. Askemos implemented this approach in 2002 using Scheme (later adding SQLite) as contract script language.

One proposal for using bitcoin for replicated asset registration and contract execution is called "colored coins". Replicated titles for potentially arbitrary forms of property, along with replicated contract execution, are implemented in different projects.

As of 2015, UBS was experimenting with "smart bonds" that use the bitcoin blockchain[46] in which payment streams could hypothetically be fully automated, creating a self-paying instrument.

## Security in Smart Contracts

A blockchain-based smart contract is visible to all users of said blockchain. However, this leads to a situation where bugs, including security holes, are visible to all yet may not be quickly fixed. Such an attack, difficult to fix quickly, was successfully executed on The DAO in June 2016, draining US$50 million in Ether while developers attempted to come to a solution that would gain consensus. The DAO program had a time delay in place before the hacker could remove the funds; a hard fork of the Ethereum software was done to claw back the funds from the attacker before the time limit expired.

Issues in Ethereum smart contracts, in particular, include ambiguities and easy-but-insecure constructs in its contract language Solidity, compiler bugs, Ethereum Virtual Machine bugs, attacks on the blockchain network, the immutability of bugs and that there is no central source documenting known vulnerabilities, attacks and problematic constructs.

## Caracteristics of Smart Legal Contracts

Smart legal contracts are distinct from smart contracts. As mentioned above, a smart contract is not necessarily legally enforceable as a contract. On the other hand, a smart legal contract has all the elements of a legally enforceable contract in the jurisdiction in which it can be enforced and it can be enforced by a court or tribunal. Therefore, while every smart legal contract will contain some elements of a smart contract, not every smart contract will be a smart legal contract.

There is no formal definition of a smart legal contract in the legal industry.

A Ricardian contract is a type of smart legal contract.

## How are Smart Contracts used ?

Nowadays, businesses want to streamline their processes and accelerate current workflows. Most are using tools like marketing automation platforms to simplify their operations to the hilt.

Businesses can leverage smart contracts for these and a host of other applications. Here are some smart contract examples that digital contracts provide.

![simple to complex use](https://github.com/aridiosilva/SmartContractsBlockchain/blob/main/Smart-Contracts-Use-Cases-Simple-to-Complex.png)

> - **a) Legal Use** - *The obvious sector that would take advantage of smart contracts is the legal profession. These new digital forms of contracts will change how documents will be certified. Smart contracts offer a cost-efficient, impartial solution for people. The need for cumbersome notarization decreases.*
> - **b) Government Use** - *With the help of smart contracts, government agencies can easily enact deals to uphold democratic and legal endeavors. A city or municipal government can integrate smart contracts in its voting system. The likelihood of any election-related crimes will become impossible since votes are stored in a highly-secured distributed ledger.*
> - **c) Healthcare Use** - *Smart contracts help healthcare companies provide confidence to patients that their personal information is safe. They can enhance the insurance trial processes and offer easy access to cross-institutional data. Digital contracts allow seamless monitoring of patient interactions and easy tracking of system efficiencies. Combining smart contracts with reliable medical practice management software solutions can help elevate productivity.*
> - **d) Real Estate Use** - *Real estate firms can use smart contracts for signing deals between buyers and sellers, renters and owners, etc. One online real estate marketplace, Propy, is already among the many uses of smart contracts. Buyers can easily search and buy using the system, which offers unparalleled fairness and legality. 
To further boost productivity, it’s good to integrate digital contracts with today’s best real estate management software solutions.*
> - **e) Merchandising Use** - *Supply chains usually involve negotiations. They would stand to benefit immensely from smart contracts. Supplier and logistics firms can use smart contracts to minimize risks and automate tasks like invoicing and product releasing. The system can execute deals and manage approvals. Smart contracts can be used regardless of the type of marketplace or the things being sold.*

# How does a smart contract work?

A smart contract is a computer application that operates inside a blockchain. Two or several parties agree to the set of rules stored in the contract.

It’s like a typical application that implements some business rules. It can only use a blockchain as a database. Here are the key aspects of a smart contract:

> -**1- Identify Agreement** - *Parties engaged in the smart contract determine a shared, agreed opportunity and intended results. Possible agreements are vast, from simple business transactions and rights transfer to asset swaps*
> -**2- Set Conditions** - *Parties can decide either to initiate their digital contracts by themselves or by fulfilling certain criteria such as natural disasters or financial market movements. Other conditions that could launch smart contracts include religious occasions or important holidays.*
> -**3- Code the Business Logic** - *Like other computer programs, a smart contract is an application designed to automatically perform once the conditional parameters are reached.*
> -**4- Encryption & Blockchain Technology** - *In a blockchain, encryption is used. This provides the needed security in authenticating and verifying the messages exchanged among the involved parties.*
> **5- Processing & Execution** - *A smart contract gets written to a block in a blockchain iteration. This occurs after reaching consensus via validation and authentication. Once the code is executed, the results are memorized for verification and compliance.*
> -  **6- Network Updates** - *Every computer connected to a blockchain network automatically updates its ledgers. This demonstrates the blockchain’s new state. Upon authentication and posting, no one can alter a record in a blockchain. Only append-only actions can be done.*

# What are the benefits of Smart Contracts?

Here are some of the major benefits that smart contracts can bring to your business:

> - **Direct business relationships** - *The blockchain continues to function as prearranged. All agreed terms and conditions are accessible and visible to concerned parties. Because of its design, it’s impossible to dispute the stipulations the moment a smart contract has been determined. This makes smart contracts highly reliable.*
> - **Integrity & Trustworthiness** - *The network will sustain its integrity. The terms and conditions of smart contracts are visible and accessible to trusted parties. There’s no way to dispute the conditions of a smart contract. The parties can fully rely on the smart contract.*
> - **Speed & Security** - *Smart contracts use code and live on the internet. They execute transactions quickly. This saves time for many business processes and eliminates the need to process documents manually. Smart contracts use the same level of security as a cryptocurrency. As of today, they’re the safest way to store data on the web.*
> - **Efficient records keeping** - * Each smart contract is a digital record that can be easily stored and accessed as needed.*
> - **Paper-free** - * Smart contracts are stored digital space, securely and cost-efficiently.*
